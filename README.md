  - **Message** (required textarea for comments)
  - **How did you hear about us?** (radio buttons for user selection)
- The form is configured to submit data via the `POST` method to a placeholder action (`#`).

### 3. **Images**
- A placeholder image is displayed as an example product image.
- An additional **bonus image** is included with:

## File Structure

- **HTML File**: The main file, `knowledgecheckm4.html`, contains all the HTML5 elements.
- **Images**:
  - Placeholder image (linked from an external source: https://placehold.co).
  - Bonus image (`happydog.jpg`) is assumed to be in the same directory as the HTML file.

## How to Use
1. Save the file as `knowledgecheckm4.html`.
2. Ensure the `happydog.jpg` image is in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Open the file in a web browser to view the content.

## Bonus Features
